# xyOps Project Governance Charter

### 1. Guiding Principles

The xyOps project exists to empower users and developers through openness, reliability, and fairness.  Our governance model is designed to preserve these principles indefinitely:

- **Open Access:** All source code, tools, and documentation will be freely available under the BSD 3-Clause License in perpetuity.
- **Transparency:** All decisions affecting the project are made publicly and archived for accountability.
- **Meritocracy:** Technical merit and community trust guide decision-making; not titles or corporate affiliation.
- **Continuity:** Stewardship of xyOps must always serve the longevity and stability of the project above all else.

### 2. Governance Model

xyOps currently operates under a **Steward-Led** governance model, transitioning toward **Community-Led Stewardship** as the contributor base grows.

- **Steward-Led Phase:** PixlCore LLC and Joseph Huckaby are the initial maintainers and release stewards.
	- All technical and policy decisions are made in the open and documented in the repository.
- **Community-Led Phase (in development):**  
	- A small group of trusted contributors, known as the **Steering Committee**, will be invited to guide roadmap planning, code review policy, and succession matters.
	- Committee membership will be earned through consistent, high-quality contributions and a demonstrated commitment to the project's longevity principles.

Decisions will generally be made by **consensus**, i.e. a proposal is accepted if no one objects after a reasonable period.  If consensus cannot be reached, the Stewards will make a final call guided by the project's principles.

### 3. Roles & Responsibilities

#### Maintainers
- Have commit access and release authority.
- Review pull requests for technical soundness, style, and security.
- Ensure that all merged code remains under the BSD 3-Clause License.

#### Contributors
- Submit patches, bug reports, and documentation improvements.
- Agree that all contributions are licensed under MIT.
- May be nominated for Maintainer or Committee roles based on merit.

#### Steering Committee (Future)
- Provides continuity and high-level guidance.
- Approves new maintainers and mediates disputes.
- Oversees the project's adherence to the Longevity Pledge.

### 4. Succession & Stewardship

To ensure the long-term survival of xyOps:

- If PixlCore LLC or Joseph Huckaby are unable to continue active stewardship, **a designated successor organization** (foundation or trusted nonprofit) will inherit responsibility for maintenance and governance.
- The successor will be legally and publicly bound by the [Longevity Pledge](https://github.com/pixlcore/xyops/blob/main/LONGEVITY.md) and this charter.
- The Steering Committee (once established) will have the authority to elect new stewards or reconstitute governance as needed, provided all changes honor the project's permanent MIT licensing and open-source commitments.

### 5. Amendments

This document may be updated to reflect the project's growth, provided that:

- All changes are made through a public pull request and approved by maintainers or the Steering Committee.
- No amendment may contradict or weaken the commitments in the [Longevity Pledge](https://github.com/pixlcore/xyops/blob/main/LONGEVITY.md).

### 6. Acknowledgment

This Governance Charter formalizes the commitment that xyOps will remain not just *open source*, but *well-governed*, transparent, and community-sustained.
